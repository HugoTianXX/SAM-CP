# SAM-CP

This repository contains the implementation for the paper *Semantically Improved Adversarial Attack Based on Masked Language Model via Context Preservation*.(This repository serves as a temporary backup repository for 'https://github.com/HugoTianXX/SAM-CP' (the HugoTianX account is set to be invisible by the system, we have contacted Github and submitted a work order))

## Model Training

This repository provides a JSON-formatted dataset template designed for fine-tuning tasks. The template includes original text and a set of candidate replacement words for specific positions in the text.

To train the model, run:

```bash
python train_xxx.py
```
